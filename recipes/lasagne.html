<p><h2>Lasagne</h2></p>

<p>Lasagna just rocks. Full stop.

    And if you've never tried a homemade one before, that needs to change! If you can make spaghetti bolognese, you can make lasagne. It just requires a wee bit more patience.
</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 onion</li>
    <li>1 medium carrot</li>
    <li>1 celery stick</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>1 kg / 2 lb beef mince</li>
    <li>800g / 28 oz canned crushed tomato</li>
    <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 cup pinot noir red wine</li>
    <li>3 beef bouillon cubes</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp EACH dried thyme and oregano</li>
    <li>2 tsp Worcestershire Sauce</li>
    <li>1 – 2 tsp sugar</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium low heat. Add flour and mix constantly for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Pour about 1 cup of the milk in, mixing as you go to incorporate into the flour mixture. Once mostly lump free, add remaining milk. Use a whisk if needed to make it lump free.</li>
    <li>Turn heat up to medium high. Stir occasionally at first then regularly after a few minutes until sauce thickens – about 5 – 8 minutes. It should coat the back of the wooden spoon.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat, add cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix until the cheese is melted. The Sauce should be thick but still easily pourable – the consistency of heavy cream (you need to be able to drizzle it over the Ragu when layering – see video). If it’s too thick, add a splash of water or milk.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.</li>
    <li>Use a 33 x 22 x 7 cm / 13 x 9 x 2.5″ baking dish.</li>
    <li>Smear a bit of Ragu on the base, then cover with lasagna sheets. Tear sheets to fit.</li>
    <li>Spread over 2 1/2 cups of Ragu (enough to cover sheets), then drizzle over 1 cup of Cheese Sauce.</li>
    <li>Top with lasagna sheets (Note 7). Spread with another 2 1/2 cups of Ragu, then 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. Top with lasagna sheets then repeat 1 more time.</li>
    <li>Top with a 4th layer of lasagna sheets, then pour over the remaining Cheese Sauce.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with Mozzarella, then bake for 25 minutes or until golden and bubbling.</li>
    <li>Stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving, garnished with basil or parsley if desired.</li>
</ol>
