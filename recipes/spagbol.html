<p><h2>Spaghetti Bolegnese</h2></p>

<p>t is thoroughly Aussie to shorten Spaghetti Bolognese to Spag Bol!

    And here she is – my Spag Bol. Rich, thick, incredible flavour in the sauce even if you only have time for a quick 20 minute simmer. 
</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>1 onion</li>
    <li>1 lb / 500g beef mince (ground beef)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) dry red wine</li>
    <li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
    <li>800g / 28 oz can crushed tomato</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 tsp white sugar</li>
    <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
    <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme </li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
    <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
    <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.</li>
    <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
    <li>Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 – 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)</li>
    <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti – though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
</ol>
