Odin (Old Norse: Óðinn) is the main god in Norse mythology. Described as an immensely wise, one-eyed old man, Odin has by far the most varied characteristics of any of the gods and is not only the deity to call upon when war was being prepared but is also the god of poetry, of the dead, of runes, and of magic.13 Nov 2017
<p>He also exists in Germanic mythology as Woden (in Old English), Wodan (in Old Franconian), and Wutan or Wuotan (in Old High German). The modern English weekday name Wednesday traces its origins to "day of Woden", wōdnesdæg in Old English, and is still seen in the Dutch name woensdag.</p>
